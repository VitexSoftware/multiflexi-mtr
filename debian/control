Description: Check your network using MultiFlexi
 MTR probes routers on the route path by limiting the number of hops
 individual packets may traverse, and listening to responses of their
 expiry. It will regularly repeat this process, usually once per
 second, and keep track of the response times of the hops along
 the path.
